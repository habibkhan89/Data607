Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.Our Values----------We believe we can help build a future for everyone.We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.The Opportunity---------------The ideal candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field and experience working with product data sets and making data-driven decisions.

We're pairing engineering with grant-making, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of our work is our partnership with Summit Learning -- a personalized approach to education developed by Summit Public Schools in partnership with learning scientists, researchers, and academics. With Summit Learning, students gain the skills, knowledge and habits to succeed in college and enter adulthood with a clear vision for achieving purpose and well-being in life.Our Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring & evaluating product & program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding etc. The data science team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates & communicates with the cross-functional & leadership teams.The position is full-time and based in Redwood City.You will--------Leverage data to understand product and execute projects to drive engagement of users on existing features & new pilots.Collaborate & communicate with product, engineering, data, research, user research and educators to execute and inform on projects.Design and develop product metrics, create insightful automated dashboards and data visualization to track them and extract actionable product insights.Develop exploratory & deep-dive analysis to evaluate hypothesis.Analyze both structured and unstructured data.Conduct written and verbal presentation to share insights and recommendations to audiences of varying levels of technical sophistication.You have--------1-2 years of product related work experience or equivalent within tech, finance, consulting or a related industry.Experience in quantitative or statistical analysis, for example, hypothesis testing, experimentation, statistical modeling, time series analysis, natural language processing and psychometrics.Experience in metrics development, data exploration, solving problems using data, building product intuition, data visualization, and providing practical business insight using data.Proficient in SQL and R or Python.Excellent communications skills, with the ability to synthesize, simplify and explain complex problems to different types of audience with varied technical skills.Experience in working with cross-functional teams of product managers, engineers, designers, researchers and other data scientists & analysts."

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.Our Values----------We believe we can help build a future for everyone.We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.The Opportunity---------------The ideal candidate will have a background in a quantitative or technical field and experience working with product data sets and making data-driven decisions.

We're pairing engineering with grant-making, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there. An example of our work is our partnership with Summit Learning -- a personalized approach to education developed by Summit Public Schools in partnership with learning scientists, researchers, and academics. With Summit Learning, students gain the skills, knowledge and habits to succeed in college and enter adulthood with a clear vision for achieving purpose and well-being in life.Our Education Data Science team is responsible for measuring & evaluating product & program changes. For example, how product impacts student performance on cognitive skills, how schools onboard onto the program or how professional development impacts on onboarding etc. The data science team defines measurements, product metrics, provides product insights through analysis, recommends what to improve and build next, as well as collaborates & communicates with the cross-functional & leadership teams.The position is full-time and based in Redwood City.You will--------Leverage data to understand product and execute projects to drive engagement of users on existing features & new pilots.Collaborate & communicate with product, engineering, data, research, user research and educators to execute and inform on projects.Design and develop product metrics, create insightful automated dashboards and data visualization to track them and extract actionable product insights.Develop exploratory & deep-dive analysis to evaluate hypothesis.Analyze both structured and unstructured data.Conduct written and verbal presentation to share insights and recommendations to audiences of varying levels of technical sophistication.You have--------1-2 years of product related work experience or equivalent within tech, finance, consulting or a related industry.Experience in quantitative or statistical analysis, for example, hypothesis testing, experimentation, statistical modeling, time series analysis, natural language processing and psychometrics.Experience in metrics development, data exploration, solving problems using data, building product intuition, data visualization, and providing practical business insight using data.Proficient in SQL and R or Python.Excellent communications skills, with the ability to synthesize, simplify and explain complex problems to different types of audience with varied technical skills.Experience in working with cross-functional teams of product managers, engineers, designers, researchers and other data scientists & analysts."
